**Writing a Docker Compose for a FastAPI Application with PostgreSQL**

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to use Docker Compose to build and run a FastAPI application along with a PostgreSQL database container that it depends on. Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications by allowing you to define and run them with a single configuration file.

**1. Setting up the FastAPI Application:**

Before we create the Docker Compose file, ensure you have a FastAPI application ready. If you don't have one yet, create a directory for your project and set up a basic FastAPI application. For example, create a file named `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

**2. Writing the Docker Compose File:**

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as your FastAPI application. This file will contain the configuration for your FastAPI application and the PostgreSQL database.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: fastapi_db
      POSTGRES_USER: fastapi_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: fastapi_password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  fastapi:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://fastapi_user:fastapi_password@postgres/fastapi_db
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    depends_on:
      - postgres

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**3. Configuring the FastAPI Application:**

In your FastAPI application, ensure that you use the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to connect to the PostgreSQL database. For example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from databases import Database

app = FastAPI()

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://fastapi_user:fastapi_password@postgres/fastapi_db"

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    db = Database(DATABASE_URL)
    # Your database operations here
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```

**4. Building and Running the Application:**

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your FastAPI application and the `docker-compose.yml` file, and run the following command to build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker image for your FastAPI application and start both the FastAPI and PostgreSQL containers.

**5. Accessing the FastAPI Application:**

You can now access your FastAPI application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser or using an API testing tool like Postman.

**Conclusion:**

In this tutorial, you learned how to use Docker Compose to build and run a FastAPI application along with a PostgreSQL database container that it depends on. Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container applications, allowing you to define and run them with a single configuration file.
