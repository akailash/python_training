**Python Basics Tutorial**

Welcome to the Python Basics Tutorial! In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Python programming language, which will serve as a foundation for your journey into building powerful applications. Let's get started!

**1. Introduction to Python:**
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for various purposes such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

**2. Setting Up Environment:**
Before you start coding in Python, you need to set up your development environment. Here's a basic guide to get you started:
- Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/). Make sure to select the appropriate version for your operating system.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Choose an IDE to write and execute Python code. Some popular choices include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook.

**3. Python Basics:**
Let's dive into some basic Python concepts:

**a. Syntax and Basic Structure:**
Python code is written in plain text files with the ".py" extension. Here's a simple example of a Python script:
```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, world!")  # This prints "Hello, world!" to the console
```

**b. Data Types:**
Python supports various data types, including:
- Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -3)
- Float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5)
- String: Sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello", 'Python')
- Boolean: True or False

**c. Variables and Variable Assignments:**
Variables are used to store data values. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator "=".
```python
x = 5  # Assigning the value 5 to variable x
name = "John"  # Assigning the string "John" to variable name
```

**d. Basic Operations:**
Python supports various arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
```python
# Arithmetic Operations
result = 10 + 5  # Addition
result = 10 - 5  # Subtraction
result = 10 * 5  # Multiplication
result = 10 / 5  # Division

# Comparison Operations
x = 10
y = 5
result = x > y  # Greater than
result = x == y  # Equal to
result = x != y  # Not equal to

# Logical Operations
a = True
b = False
result = a and b  # Logical AND
result = a or b   # Logical OR
result = not a    # Logical NOT
```

**4. Control Structures:**
Control structures allow you to control the flow of your program. Python supports conditional statements and loops.
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
```
- Loops (for loops, while loops)
```python
# For Loop
for i in range(5):  # Iterate over a range of numbers (0 to 4)
    print(i)

# While Loop
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

Congratulations! You've completed the Python Basics Tutorial. Take some time to practice these concepts before moving on to the next stage of your Python journey. If you have any questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask. Happy coding!
